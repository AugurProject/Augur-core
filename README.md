# augur-core

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/AugurProject/augur-core.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/AugurProject/augur-core)

Ethereum contracts for a decentralized prediction market platform.

## Installation

You should already have a system-wide installation of Python and it should be
Python 2.7.

First install the dependencies, which include PyEthereum (the tool used to test
Ethereum smart contracts from Python scripts) and the Serpent smart contract
programming language:

```
sudo pip install -r requirements.txt
```

On macOS you will need to use a
[virtualenv](https://python-guide-pt-br.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/)
or use a [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) Python to work around System Integrity
Protection.

Now we can try running some tests to make sure our installation worked:

```
cd tests
python runtests.py
```

## Docker

You may run augur-core using docker as follows:

### Build:

```
docker image build --tag augur-core-tests --file Dockerfile-test .
```

### Run:

```
docker container run --rm -it augur-core-tests
```

### Debug:

```
docker container run --rm -it --entrypoint /bin/bash augur-core-tests
py.test -s tests/trading_tests.py
```

## Terminology

[Augur Terminology](http://blog.augur.net/faq/all-terms/)

## Src Folders

The source code folders are split into six folders: extensions, factories, 
libraries, macros, reporting, and trading. Splitting the folders this way
allows for a separation of concerns and better modularity. 
- src/extensions -- contains files that deal with market creation, bond validity, 
getting the market price and reporting fee in attoeth (10^-18 eth), creating order
books, reporting messages, and getting free REP (reputationTokens)
- src/factories -- contains files that are constructors for branches, markets, 
reputation Tokens, reporting Periods/Windows, tradeable asset shareTokens, and topics for prediction. 
- src/libraries -- contains data structures used elsewhere in the source code. 
- src/macros -- contains macros for unit conversions and math.
- src/reporting -- contains source files for the creation and manipulation of branches, 
markets, and various types of tokens (registration Tokens, reporting Tokens, and reputation Tokens).
- src/trading -- contains source code files that handle user actions regarding 
orders, claims, topics, and other trade functions.

## Serpent vs. Solidity

Augur uses (Serpent)[https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Serpent] for smart 
contracts over Solidity. While Serpent increases user risk, as it has a small development community,
Solidity has a more complex syntax and is less aligned with the EVM (Ethereum Virtual
Machine) due to byte packing of numbers. Serpent’s syntax is aligned with Python, so contract writers do not need 
to learn another language. Here is a guide to [learn Serpent](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~elaine/smartcontract/guide.pdf) (PDF),
and a (linter)[https://github.com/beaugunderson/serplint] to check Serpent code. 

## Security model

The security model is based on the idea that reporters will want to invest 
in a market where honesty prevails, and will not trust fraudulent markets. 
For example, assume that there exist two almost identical universes: an honest 
universe, where the factually correct answer is the predominant answer, and a 
fraudulent universe, where incorrect answers are predominant in order to cheat 
the system. The REP in the fraudulent universe will approach 0, and the REP in 
the honest universe will approach the theoretical yield. This phenomenon occurs 
because reporters do not want to trade on markets in a dishonest universe. Therefore, 
they will not create markets in a dishonest universe. Ultimately, the REP holders 
will not receive any market fees.
 
In order to create a fraudulent universe, an attacker must fork the main branch. 
They will need to buy a large share of REP and stake it on the lie outcome, 
as nobody else will want to engage in a deceitful market. In principle, 
the attacker will lose up to 2.5 times the maximum profit made from a 
successful attack, and their REP will approach 0.
 
The mutex (src/mutex.se) and controller (src/controller.se) contracts 
also help uphold security. One can also attack Ethereum contracts by 
creating a chain of wanted contract calls through a malicious user. 
The mutex contract prevents against that by preventing someone from 
re-entering the contracts before they return. The controller contract serves to
update Augur and stores a registry of whitelisted contract addresses. The 
controller also can perform administrative actions, such as transferring ownership 
and performing emergency stop functions. It can be operated in either the 
developer mode, where the developer updates contracts, or the decentralized 
mode, when people must upload contracts to make changes and therefore, the 
market creators/traders must cancel orders and shift to the new contract. 
For bugs found involving money or REP, contracts are locked / an escape 
hatch is enabled which allows withdrawal of shares [and cancelling orders] 
for a value half-way between the bid-ask spread at the time of the lock. 
In addition, another escape hatch is enabled, which allows withdrawal of any locked up REP.

## Contract Uploader

The contract uploader temporarily creates a directory and copies the uploaded
files within. It strips the header (license and import statements), and 
gets the name of each contract. The externs are updated with the import 
statements. For each contract, a controller is created and its address is 
set to the contract’s address. Finally, the addresses are added to the 
whitelist, and contracts are compiled. If all contracts compile successfully, 
any temporary files are deleted. Otherwise, contract writers must re-upload
the necessary files after fixing errors.

## API Maker Scripts

The API Maker script parses through files ending with the token “data_api”. 
It extracts contract API locally from a file, and remotely from GitHub. It 
reads existing contract API info from augur-contracts/api.json, and then 
adds the newly obtained information to the the existing information. Subsequently,
all contracts’ API information is updated. Finally, all contract API is 
put together in a file and printed to the screen.

## Testing

The tests directory (augur-core/tests) contain tests and test fixtures to test 
the various functionalities present in Augur, including trading, reporting, and wcl tests.
- conftest.py -- contains the class ContractFixture, which deals with 
caching compiled contracts, signatures, etc. as well as resetting the blockchain before each test.
- delegation_sandbox.py -- tests the delegator contract. 
- sandbox.py -- used for testing miscellaneous Serpent behaviors
- reporting -- contains tests for reporting purposes.
- trading -- contains tests for trading purposes.
- serpent_test_helpers -- Includes macros (ie safeMath.sem) and other small contracts to help run tests.
- test_controller.py -- tests controller functionalities.
- test_mutex.py -- tests mutex functionalities.
- test_helpers.py -- tests the controller, safeMath, and assertNoValue macros.
- test_legacyRep.py -- tests the legacyRepTokens’ functionalities.
- utils.py -- contains useful functions for testing, such as conversion between different data types.
- wcl-in-python.py -- contains functions for making and taking various types of bids.
- wcl.txt -- explains tests for the various situations when filling a bid and filling an ask.
 
In order to run Augur’s test suite, run the following inside the tests directory:
```
cd augur-core/tests
pytest
```
This executes all the tests. To run a test individually, run the following:
```
pytest path/to/test_file.py -k 'name_of_test’
```

By default the trading WCL fuzz testing is not run, if you want to run it specifically do
```
export INCLUDE_FUZZY_TESTS=1
pytest trading/test_wcl_fuzzy.py
unset INCLUDE_FUZZY_TESTS
```

Or if you want to run all tests (including fuzzy):

```
export INCLUDE_FUZZY_TESTS=1
pytest
unset INCLUDE_FUZZY_TESTS
```

When writing tests, it is highly recommended to make use of the ContractFixtures 
class for ‘placeholder’ variables. Python’s unit testing framework comes 
handy here; encapsulate tests within functions that start with “test_”, and 
use “assert” statements when testing for certain values. Parameterized tests are 
recommended as well to test various possibilities and edge cases.

## Additional notes

There are no floats in Serpent.

Strings are stored numerically as integers.

All augur-core contracts use fixedpoint (no floats). So sub-ether values in
Serpent would be represented as integers whose value is in wei (attoEthers or
10**-18 Ethers).

To give an example, 200\*base / 5 would be 40 in that base.

To multiply two
fixed point numbers like 5 times 10 an example in base 10\*\*18 would be
5\*10\*\*18 \* 10\*10\*\*18 / 10\*\*18 (we divide by the base to keep it in
base 10\*\*18).

For a division example, 18/10 would be 18\*10\*\*18 \* 10\*\*18 /
(10\*10\*\*18).

Also note, Mist uses a different contract abi style than usual, to convert use the following regex \((.\*?)\) and replace with nothing [except don't do it for events].
